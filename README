# CryptoWalletSim

CryptoWalletSim is a command-line application written in modern C++ that simulates wallet management and Bitcoin tracking. It leverages multi-threading capabilities to provide efficient processing of user commands.

## Description

This project is designed to help users understand multi-threading concepts in C++ and demonstrate how to interact with external APIs to track Bitcoin prices.

## Usage

To use CryptoWalletSim, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: Clone or download the project to your Windows-based system.

2. **Compile**: Compile the application using a C++ compiler of your choice. Make sure to have the necessary build tools installed.

3. **Run**: Execute the compiled binary to start CryptoWalletSim.

### Platform Compatibility

CryptoWalletSim is designed for Windows-based systems due to its reliance on platform-specific functionality provided by `conio.h`, which is not available on Linux or other non-Windows platforms.

## Features

- Simulate wallet management.
- Track live Bitcoin prices.
- Interactive command-line interface.
